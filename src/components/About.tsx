          I'm a passionate Software Engineer from Kolkata, India, who loves coding and games. 
          Currently pursuing my education at Jadavpur University, I'm deeply interested in 
          learning AI/ML and exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. 
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming or experimenting with new technologies 
          to bring creative ideas to life.
